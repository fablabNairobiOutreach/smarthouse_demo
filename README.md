## About ##
The Smart House Model is a simple set up made from locally available materials and simple electric circuit connections whose main aim is to simplify house chores by automating them. The model is an easy way of:  
      1.	Showing the students practical applications of the Science learnt in class.  
      2.	Getting students interested in Science and Engineering.  
      3.	Encouraging innovation among the students.  

## Specifications ##
The set up focuses on the following areas around the house:  
      •	Automated Theatre room lighting  
      •	Automated front door  
      •	Automated security back door  
      •	Automated house lighting  

## Use Cases ##
This is an simple introductory project for students to learn the basics of hardware & software and how both(hardware and software) come together to form one functional system.  

## Components ##

For the Theatre room lighting : [Light dependent resistor ,LED , resistors]  
For the Automated door : [Ultrasound sensor,Servo motor]  
For the Back door alarm system : [Servo motor ,green LED,blue LED ,red LED,Buzzer]
